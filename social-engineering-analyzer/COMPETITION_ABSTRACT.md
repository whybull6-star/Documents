## Detailed Abstract (100 words max)

**Lurantis** is a Web3 security platform leveraging Qdrant vector database and AI to analyze on-chain wallet behavior and detect social engineering attacks. Using semantic similarity search across specialized collections, it identifies SIM swapping attempts, wallet stalking patterns, address spoofing, and transaction anomalies. The system converts wallet characteristics and transaction patterns into 768-dimensional vectors, enabling fast similarity matching against known attack patterns. Built on Gnosis Chain with MetaMask integration, Lurantis provides real-time risk scoring, behavioral clustering, and actionable security insights. The platform helps users identify suspicious wallets before interacting, protecting against sophisticated blockchain-based social engineering attacks.
