**Vector representation:** Transaction patterns as vectors  
**Query type:** "Find wallets that behave like this one"

#### 3. Scammer Network Mapping
**Use case:** Find connections between different scam operations  
**Vector representation:** Multi-dimensional relationship vectors  
**Query type:** "Show me all accounts related to this scammer"
