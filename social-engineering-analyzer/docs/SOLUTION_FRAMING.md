# Solution Framing Exercise

## 🎯 Purpose

Before writing code, clearly frame:
- **What** we're building
- **Why** it matters
- **How** it's different
- **Who** it's for

---

## One-Sentence Pitch

**Draft 1:** [Your current idea]
```
[Write your current one-sentence pitch here]
```

**Refined version:** [After research]
```
[Update after completing research]
```

---

## Problem-Solution Fit

### The Problem:
```
[One clear sentence describing the problem]
```

**Why is this urgent?**
```
[Why can't people wait? What's the cost of not solving this?]
```

### The Solution:
```
[One clear sentence describing what we build]
```

**Why does it work?**
```
[Why is our approach the right way to solve this?]
```

### The Unique Angle:
```
[What makes us different from existing solutions?]
```

## User Story Template

**As a** [specific user type],  
**I want to** [specific action],  
**So that** [specific benefit].

### Example:
**As a** crypto user receiving suspicious DMs,  
**I want to** quickly check if a message is a scam,  
**So that** I don't lose my funds to fraudsters.

### Your User Stories:

**Story 1:**
```
As a [user type],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit].
```

**Story 2:**
```
As a [user type],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit].
```

**Story 3:**
```
As a [user type],
I want to [action],
So that [benefit].
```

## Feature Prioritization

### Must Have (MVP):
```
- [Feature 1] - Why it's critical
- [Feature 2] - Why it's critical
- [Feature 3] - Why it's critical
```

### Should Have (V1):
```
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
```

### Nice to Have (Future):
```
- [Feature 1]
- [Feature 2]
```

## Success Metrics

### How do we know it works?

**Technical metrics:**
- [ ] Accuracy: [Target %]
- [ ] Speed: [Target time]
- [ ] Coverage: [Target %]

**User metrics:**
- [ ] Adoption: [Target users]
- [ ] Retention: [Target %]
- [ ] Satisfaction: [Target score]

**Business metrics:**
- [ ] Revenue: [Target $]
- [ ] Conversion: [Target %]
- [ ] Cost per user: [Target $]

## Risks & Assumptions

### Assumptions We're Making:
```
1. [Assumption] - How we'll validate
2. [Assumption] - How we'll validate
3. [Assumption] - How we'll validate
```

### Risks:
```
1. [Risk] - Mitigation plan
2. [Risk] - Mitigation plan
3. [Risk] - Mitigation plan
```

## Go/No-Go Criteria

**We should proceed if:**
- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]

**We should pivot if:**
- [ ] [Red flag 1]
- [ ] [Red flag 2]
- [ ] [Red flag 3]

## Final Validation Checklist

Before building, confirm:

- [ ] Clear problem statement (one sentence)
- [ ] Defined target user (specific persona)
- [ ] Unique value proposition (how we're different)
- [ ] Feasible MVP scope (can build in timeframe)
- [ ] Access to required data/APIs
- [ ] Defined success criteria
- [ ] Identified main risks
- [ ] Plan for validation/testing
